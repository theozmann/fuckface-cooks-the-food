Hello!
This is a rendition of the Odin Project's recipes lesson. You may have noticed
I already have an Odin recipes repo from some time ago. I lost track of time
and haven't practiced in awhile, so I'm redoing some of these earlier lessons.
In this project I am implementing some silly recipes depicted in my favorite 
podcast; F**kFace, which can be found here: https://roosterteeth.com/series/f-kface

I will mostly be working with HTML to start and intent to return with CSS and maybe
SASS or Bootstrap to pretty it up and make it much more attractive.
